Extract this into data/ (data/seg_pred, data/seg_test, data/seg_train)

### Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding

- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem objective?
- Does the student interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?
- Is domain knowledge demonstrated when interpreting results?

### Project Organization

- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?
- Is markdown formatting used appropriately to structure notebooks?

- Are there unnecessary files included?
- Do files and directories have well-structured, appropriate, consistent names?

### Python Syntax and Control Flow

- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follows general best practices and style guidelines?
- Are Pandas and sklearn functions used appropriately?
